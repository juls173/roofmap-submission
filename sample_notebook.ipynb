    "#### Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Solar energy plays a crucial role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and meeting rising energy demands. Information on building roof types and geometry is essential for assessing solar potential, improving energy efficiency, and supporting energy transition policies. Roof material and shape data also can inform studies on thermal efficiency, roof durability, disaster risk, heritage conservation, urban heat, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study aims to develop a ready-to-use, AI-ready open dataset containing building roof types and geometry, along with a scalable pipeline for roof material classification. The dataset is created using OpenStreetMap (OSM) roof material labels and high-resolution satellite imagery obtained from [OpenAerialMap](https://map.openaerialmap.org/#/7.164459228515626,50.84562199133437,12/square/12020303222/617970f8800b10000509eda7?_k=h73n1n), originally from the Maxar [Open Data Program](https://www.maxar.com/open-data), leveraging OSM building outlines to avoid computationally expensive segmentation processes. This notebook includes the code to obtain and preprocess this data, which can be used to transform any geospatial dataset into the YOLO dataset format, in addition to training a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the dataset’s applicability, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, specifically, Ultralytics' YOLOv11, is used to classify roofs into categories such as roof tiles, tar paper, and metal, followed by an evaluation of the model’s performance."

This involves slicing the input raster image into overlapping patches and generating corresponding label files based on the roof material polygons from the GeoJSON. Each patch is filtered to ensure it contains a minimum number of labeled buildings. For valid patches, the building footprints are clipped, normalized, and saved in YOLO segmentation format. The dataset is then automatically split into training, validation, and test sets, and saved in a structured format. A YAML configuration file is also created to define the dataset structure and class labels for use during model training.\n",
